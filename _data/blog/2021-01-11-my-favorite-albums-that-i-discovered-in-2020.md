For me, music was always a source of inspiration that allowed me to discover new ideas and boundaries of my creativity. Listening to good music puts me into a different emotional state where I can close my eyes and vividly dream about something imaginary yet so intimate. It also acts as an abstract medium through which I can relate to others' feelings without explicitly expressing them verbally. So, I wanted to share my favorite albums of 2020 for you to explore new music and immerse yourself in the vibrant emotional narrative that they offer. I have also included my personal favorite from each album that resonated with me the most as an introductory piece that you might want to start off with.

## Ylang Ylang - FKJ

I discovered French Kiwi Juice (FKJ), a singer and multi-instrumentalist producer, completely by accident by playing a video on YouTube, where beautiful landscapes of South East Asia are fused along with calm, intimate melody verse to form an aesthetically pleasing music video. That song carries the same name as the album itself - "Ylang Ylang". Later, I discovered that this song, as well as the rest of the album, was produced by FKJ in an isolated jungle studio that he set up in the Philippines. The entire album is a manifestation of his intimate feelings and synergy with nature.

### Introduction

The music video I talked about above. It is a must-watch. Period.

## Blonde - Frank Ocean

This album is a masterpiece created by Frank Ocean, an American singer and visual artist, after four years of silence in 2016. The atmosphere that the album creates with hypnotic beats and deep narrative greatly resonates with the young generation. His songs are filled with vivid imagery that sets a mood of comfort and nostalgia. Despite his success and great admiration from fans, Frank remains to be a very enigmatic person, preferring privacy in all aspects of his life.

### Introduction

"*Get lost in the sprawling colorful landscapes of Hayao Miyazaki and through the dark and twisted streets of Katsuhiro Otomo's Neo Tokyo. These worlds breathe life into Frank Ocean's symphonic soundscapes.*" - Justin West and Alex Rivera. May this beautiful mashup video act as a pathway into Frank Ocean's art.

## After Hours - 53 Thieves

53 Thieves is a group of artists, "2 singers + 2 producers", as they like to shortly introduce themselves. The group that amassed over 25 millions streams just on Spotify this year, has actually never met in person with each other. Their debut EP "After Hours" is a pleasant journey into the world of futuristic beats and introspective songwriting about intimate love.

### Introduction

Each song tells a different story, however, as a whole, they form a harmonious narrative that can be listened in one sitting. I would highly suggest listening to the entire album, but if you are in a hurry, try listening to "three a.m.", you might as well find more spare time for the rest of the album.

## Renaissance Boy - Galimatias

In "Renaissance Boy", as the name suggests, Galimatias rediscovers himself as an artist, introducing a completely new level of production and immersive sound, yet keeping his futuristic beats style from Urban Flora that we all loved. The album gives a feeling of intimacy, introducing the listener to distorted atmospheric sound filled with deep, soft basses. Most importantly, he heavily contributed his vocals to it, something that has been long-awaited by his fans from the platforms that supported him from the beginning, [TheSoundYouNeed](https://www.youtube.com/thesoundyouneed/featured) and [Majestic Casual](https://www.youtube.com/user/majesticcasual).

### Introduction

Again, I would suggest listening to the entire album, you cannot miss this gem. Speaking of my personal favorites, I enjoyed Redeye, Let Go and interlude Everywhere.
