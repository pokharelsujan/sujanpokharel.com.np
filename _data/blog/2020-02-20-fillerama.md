## Why would I need a blog?

The idea of creating a blog did not come from a sudden thought, it was rather accumulating and gaining traction over the course of last two years. The initial reason behind it was my English. Here is an interesting fact: although Russian is my native language, it is much easier for me to express complex thoughts in English, but it comes with a catch - it takes an enormous time for me to write them down in a cohesive academic manner. That is why I do not like writing classes. So, I thought that opening a blog would encourage me to write more and ultimately erase my writing barrier.

Another reason why I wanted to open a blog was because I really liked the idea of sharing insights and personal experiences with other people. Yes, I could do it through already available mediums such as Instagram or Twitter, but lately I have been finding these social media platforms rather toxic. Opening my own website-based blog would free me from the pressure of getting enough likes and views. Validation independence would make it truly authentic. Of course, the more people I share my ideas with, the better but that is not my main priority right now. I always wanted to independently work on something personal, perfecting every detail of it. Well, here we are.

## How it was built?

The initial plan was to build a typical MERN stack application. I proceeded coding with React until I stumbled upon [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I remember a friend of mine showed me what Gatsby.js is, but I never took the opportunity to learn it. From the first glance, Gatsby.js looked like a very promising framework that could possibly be popular in the future. It was offering better efficiency by pre-building static pages out of your React application. Plus, the process of converting your React application into Gatsby seemed to be very smooth and easy with minimal structure alteration.

Once I was familiar with Gatsby's documentation, I have started building my blog on top of an existing template that they were offering on their website. You can actually try it yourself by running these scripts below:

```git
npm install --save gatsby
gatsby new gatsby-starter-delog https://github.com/W3Layouts/gatsby-starter-delog
```

## Design Improvements

The default template was looking pretty good, however, it was plain. I especially did not like the typography spacing: margins between different text sizes were the same, which was kind of odd for a text-rich website. Instead, I used 24px spacing baseline that I successfully tested on a website I did for a start-up this summer. The idea is pretty simple: spacing increases incrementally depending on the element hierarchy, giving my text a consistent look and better readability.

```scss
--baseline: 24px;
--space-sm: calc(var(--baseline) / 2);
--space-md: var(--baseline);
--space-lg: calc(var(--baseline) * 2);
--space-xl: calc(var(--baseline) * 3);
```

I also added my own touch to the overall design of the website. I tried to use Material UI React along the way, as I was getting more confident with it. Additionally, I changed the GraphQL schema to include a flair (e.g. development, personal, academic, etc.) of the post for better visual navigation.

## Deployment

After some more coding and small design improvements, I have deployed my application to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) through GitHub. On code changes, Netlify automatically fetches the new code and deploys a new build, a practice which is known as continuous integration. Speaking of my contact form, the data is sent using fetch API to my [Formcarry](http://formcarry.com) endpoint, which informs me later through email. As an experiment, I have installed an [ImgBot](https://imgbot.net/) to my repository, that will automatically optimize all of my uploaded images and make a pull request once it is done each time.

To make things easier, here is a structure of my blog that is portrayed in the highest level of abstraction possible, while retaining the overall logic.

By the way, if you are a student, you can get a discount on a domain name just like I did on [Namecheap.com](namecheap.com) using [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers).
